    Topology define relation beetween devices in net, connection beetween and way flow data. Topology can be
                                     physical or logic. 
        Physical topology is a map of physical places where devices are and how net looks like.

         In this topology, all devices are connected to a common transmission medium.
        Commonly the medium used in this topology was coaxial cable, both thin and thick.
                        This topology was used to build local networks
        computers, "was" is the appropriate word here because it is no longer widely used.
        The advantages of this topology were the low cost and simplicity of its structure, but
        unfortunately it was a very unreliable topology and therefore fell out of use.

                    In local networks, this is the most common topology because it is simple to use
                design, construction and expansion, failure-resistant and easily manageable. It's a plus
         the fact that it can be constructed using various transmission media, such as copper twisted pair or cable
                        fiber optic or WLAN. The disadvantage of this topology is cost.

                 Topology used in the construction of extensive networks, involving the use of redundant connections

                                        LOGIC TOPOLOGY
                    Logic topology determine how data flows in the network :
                    
                                    [POINT-POINT TOPOLOGY]

                In this topology, data transfer takes place only between two devices
            in the network, which can be connected to each other directly, as well as using devices
                                intermediaries (e.g. switches).

                  In this topology, data transfer takes place via one transmission medium, which is shared by many devices.
    The device transmitting the data sends it to everyone, but only the device to which the data was addressed reads it them, 
                                            other devices ignore them.

                        Similarly to the multi-access topology, data is also sent here
                        all devices, and only the device to which they were addressed reads them. In the ring
                        there is a "token" that "circulates" between devices. It's a device that wants
                        transmit "captures" it and starts transmitting.                    
                                            
                                            
                     [LAYERS OF COMPUTER NETWORK - OSI AND TCP/IP MODELS]
                
                Comunnication beetewn device in computer network like in the other once had own rights and rules. This rules are communication protocols. They are different in the way of coummincation's. Like in exmaple in every day life specific rules of communication are different in phone call's and communication in popular messenger's like Messenger or Telegram. 


                For right working communication in computer networks we have a lot of protocols which is called a protocol set. In this set's we had a software parts and also a net devices. The most effective visualization method
                The key to interoperability between protocols is to view them as layered layers that constitute their own kind
                stack.
                
                Using this method allows you to break down the complicated issue of network communication
                into smaller elements in order to describe and understand them more easily. Moreover, the use of the model
                layering brings a number of other benefits, such as easier protocol design or
                Possibility of interoperability of network devices from different manufacturers.
                
                There are two basic models : OSI and TCP/IP
                
                                OSI                                 TCP/IP
                    7.Layer of application                4.Layer of Aplication
                    6.Layer of presentation               3.Layer of transpot
                    5.Layer of session                    2.Intenret
                    4.Layer of transport                  1.Layer with access net
                    3.Layer of net
                    2.Layer of data transfer
                    1.Physical Layer
                                            
                Model TCP/IP was created in late 70's years in XX century and it is called web structer INTERNET. THis type of structure had own 4 layers :
                    ▪️Layers of aplication working on prestation data's between user and their codding 
                    ▪️Layers of transport are giving communication through devices in net
                    ▪️Internet is a tool giving us best way to transfer data packet
                    ▪️Layer of access to net are controling devices and media
                    
                Model OSI is model created for open system which won't be
                belonged to no closed network. Due to fast growing structure of TCP/IP Model caused slower implementation OSI. Despite this we are successfully implemented a few primary protocols. Unlike TCP/IP, OSI has 7 layers, not 4. This layers is :
                     ▪️Layers of aplication which allows communication between user and for example WWW
                     ▪️Layers of presentation working with data flow and definition formats
                     ▪️Layers of session are manegment way of communication
                     ▪️Layers of transport are responsible for the integrity (i.e. consistency) of data transmission,
                     ▪️Layers of net work on choosing data flow path
                     ▪️Layers of data transfer describe methods of exchange frames beeetwen devices connected to the same hub
                     ▪️Psycical Layer are control bit flow's through web hub's
                     
                     
                     
                     
                Even if this two models are different in layers there are same protocols and web devices what we can see below

                            They can communicate with eatchother with special definied data reciving chanelles. Through running on one OS, containerization sofwater is simple way running aplications 
                            and virtualization or para-virtualization with help virtual OS.

                                      and testing in a continuous loop, allowing for incremental improvements and adjustments throughout the process
