                0.Requirment Gathering 
                -In first step client discribe to us all what he want in his product, also we are 
                able to give to client easiers methods to do work and simplify way to finall product
                1.Planing
                -Team are planing to lead project to the end, creating step by step product
                2.Design Architectures
                -Design is a proccess where Designers will create a style and look for product
                3.Development Developers
                -Development is one of most important procces while working on project, its a 
                structure that can hold all the things that client order together

                -Spiral
                    Spiral is a flexible methodology for software development. It combines elements of iterative development with the structured aspects of the waterfall model. 
                                    In simplest terms, it's a way of developing software that involves cycles of planning, risk analysis, development, 
                                      and testing in a continuous loop, allowing for incremental improvements and adjustments throughout the process
                -Big bang

                            SLDC Big Bang is a term used in software deployment, which describes the strategy of implementing a new version of a system or
                                application by instantly and comprehensively transitioning all users to the new platform at a specific point in time.
                -ETC ETC
                            ETC its just way where you must end project till dead line. No specific steps just working all together on project.
